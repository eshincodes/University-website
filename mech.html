    <h3>
        The department was established in the year 2010 with an intake 
        of 60 and increasing to 120 in 2013. Mechanical Engineering is a fast growing discipline
         in tune with the demands in the areas of Infrastructure and Manufacturing. 
         The department has well equipped laboratories as per university norms with an emphasis on
          practical approach and skills. The department has well qualified and dedicated faculty.Of the many engineering disciplines, Mechanical Engineering is the broadest, encompassing a wide variety of engineering fields and many specialties. Although it is commonly assumed that Mechanical Engineers are Automotive Engineers and Manufacturing Engineers in fact, Mechanical Engineers are employed in an enormous range of technical areas including: acoustics, air-conditioning, automatic controls, engineering design, computer-aided design, energy management, fluid dynamics, tribology, robotics, biomechanics, and turbo machinery, Nanotechnology etc.

Mechanical Engineering is a challenging, rewarding, and highly respecte
d profession. The goal of the Mechanical Engineering department is to prepare students
 for entry into the Mechanical Engineering profession, and is designed to meet a carefully 
 planned set of educational objectives. We strive to prepare our students for good employability in
  the area of Mechanical Engineering. Technical Association ‘MACHINE’ is established with its main
   objective to explore new areas of Research and latest technologies in industry. To fulfil this
    objective a series of technical workshops, seminars, technical fests and guest lectures are being 
    conducted every year. The students are encouraged to present papers and participate in various
     technical events at national level.
