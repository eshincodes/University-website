    <h3>Overview and Program Outcomes
        The field of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) has been pushing the envelope of almost all other disciplines, which use computing as a fundamental means of inquiry and tool for discovery. 
        CSE offers exciting, intellectually challenging, and rapidly growing career opportunities. 
        It is the least of where the action is, whether this means intelligent game playing, mobile applications, smart robots, cloud computing, data security, social networks, or bioinformatics. 
        The fast-changing technological scenario poses to the institute, a challenge of continuously updating its curriculum and faculty, to be able to provide state-of-the-art education and technology to the students. Changes, both major and subtle, have been made by the department of CSE to be well-prepared for a better tomorrow. The department of CSE was established in 2007 with an intake of 60, enhanced to 120 in 2009 and further to 180 in the year 2012, besides an additional 36 seats under the lateral entry scheme.
        
        <br>Computer Science and Engineering have two primary processes:<br>
        
        <br>1.Computer Hardware Design which includes an understanding of Design Methodologies for Electronic circuits, digital systems, and computer architecture of integrated circuits.<br>
      <br> 2. Computer software design which includes an understanding of design methodologies for programming, algorithms of data structures, operating systems, large-scale software development & the principles of computing as a wide variety of software applications across various computer languages.<br>
        <br>3.The teaching-learning process is given at most priority in the pursuit of improving the quality of technical education. 
        Innovative teaching aids and methodologies are used by the department toward this goal.<br> 
        The efficiency of the Teaching-Learning process is reflected in the consistently excellent results being achieved every year.<br>
        
        <br>5.The department has been striving hard to inculcate conceptual and technical skills in students through a scientific teaching methodology based on lectures, case studies, seminars, group discussions, project works, assignments, quiz programs, coding clubs, etc. The systematic and well-planned approach to problem-solving is emphasized in the classrooms and laboratories through course projects and additional computer training beyond the scope of the syllabus. <br>
        Teaching aids such as LCD Projector, OHP, CD demos, equipment demonstrations, models, charts, etc are regularly used to enhance better understanding.<br>
        
        <br>6.The department has modern laboratories and is also well-equipped with LCD projectors in each lab to serve the teaching and research needs of the student and faculty. All systems are connected to the department LAN through fiber optic which is a part of the Institute-wide area network.<br>
        
        <br>7.The CSE department exclusively holds a Library for UG course. The department takes an active role in arranging expert lectures from Industry, Guest Lectures through eminent faculty from external colleges, and Industrial Visits for the benefit of students. Students are encouraged to take up Industry Oriented projects. The students are highly motivated towards research to build up various projects using upcoming technologies. Besides these students are also motivated to present papers in various publications, journals, seminars, etc.<br>
        
        <br>8.The department organizes student counseling by the members of the faculty to monitor regularity and discipline among students. A disciplinary committee comprising the senior faculty is constituted for maintaining discipline and the dress code of the students. The department consists of a First and Second person under HOD to take care of the overall activity, discipline, etc of the department.
